# Guild Education Data Engineer Work Sample

## Project Prompt
Create a simple data processing pipeline to support a business goal.  

The business has requested a breakdown of movie genres by year as documented by  
IMDB. Write a program that processes the input file and generates an output CSV file  
with the headers “genre, year, count”.

## Solution
I utilized Jupyter Notebook along with NumPy, Pandas, and Regex libraries in order to  
analyze the data according to the prompt. I used pandas.DataFrame.head() after each   
modification to the data frame in order to quickly test if the object contained the   
data in the expected format.  

### Tasks accomplished by this program
- Downloads and uncompresses the file  
- Processes the data to meet the business requirements  
- Creates an output CSV file containing the processed data.
